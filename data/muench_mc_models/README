Notes:
    - Age in Myr. SFR names:
        : Const:  Constant SFR in linear age units

    - IMF Names:
          : Trap:  Muench et al 2002 3 power law IMF

    - Binaries:
      Every A/B binary pair corresponds to a system binary
      fraciton of f_bin. One could simply use all the stars
      as singles without worrying about the pairings.

    - All distances are DM=0.

    - All M/L relations are Bernasconi/Maedar + DM 1997.

    - M_R, N_star are:
        M_R:  Number of independent realizations
        N_stars:  Number of stars per realization.

        So a file of 10 M_R and 1e4 N_stars has 1e5 objects in it.
